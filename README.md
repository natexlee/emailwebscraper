# Email Web Scraper
This email webscraper was built using Jsoup in the Eclipse IDE. Simply enter a website url and this web scraper will fetch any emails that exist on the page!

# How It Works
• The web scraper receives a valid website URL
• The web scraper converts the website into its HTML equivalent
• The web scraper iterates through all of the HTML markup collecting all of the email links
• The web scraper returns an array containing all of the emails that were collected
